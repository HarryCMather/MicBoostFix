# MicBoostFix

Some games and programs, such as Counter-Strike Global Offensive and even Microsoft Teams sometimes ignore the microphone level you set, and either boost the microphone to 100%, or automatically adjust the volume.

This program asks you which microphone to adjust, then lets you set the level for that microphone.  Every second it will check if the level is greater than the level you set and will set it back to the level you selected (if it was greater).
